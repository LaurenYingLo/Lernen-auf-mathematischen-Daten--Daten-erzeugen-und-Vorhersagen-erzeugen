# Learning on Mathematical Data

**Mathematical Progress with AI**

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **simple AI- and search-based methods** can be applied to **mathematical data and structures**. The notebook focuses on data generation, heuristic local search, structural pattern recognition (in particular bipartite structures), and computational experiments related to classical results in graph theory such as **Mantel’s Theorem**.

The goal is not to build a high-performance system, but to provide an **exploratory and educational notebook** at the intersection of **mathematics and artificial intelligence**.

## Contents

The Jupyter Notebook is organized into the following main parts:

* **Examples** – small illustrative examples to introduce the workflow
* **Utility Functions** – helper functions used throughout the notebook
* **Data Generation** – constructing datasets from mathematical structures
* **Local Search (down-and-up)** – heuristic improvement of candidate solutions
* **Visualization Tools** – matrix heatmaps and related visual aids
* **Structure Detection (Bipartite Recognition)** – identifying bipartite structure from data
* **Classical Results** – computational illustration of Mantel’s Theorem
* **Additional Examples** – brief extensions and further ideas

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the required dependencies (a virtual environment is recommended):

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and run `Mathematischer Fortschritt mit KI.ipynb`

## Learning Objectives

* Understand how **mathematical structures can be turned into data**
* Explore the role of **heuristic search methods** in mathematical problems
* Use **visualization** to support intuition for abstract concepts
* Connect **classical mathematical theorems** with computational experiments

## Target Audience

* Students of mathematics, computer science, or data science
* Learners interested in applications of AI to mathematical research or education
* Readers who want an experimental perspective on graph theory and structural results

## Motivation

Recent advances in artificial intelligence suggest new ways of exploring mathematical structures through data-driven and computational approaches. This project is motivated by the question:

> *How far can simple AI-inspired methods help us explore, visualize, and gain intuition about classical mathematical results?*

By combining elementary heuristic search, data generation, and visualization, this notebook illustrates how AI-style thinking can complement traditional mathematical reasoning.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Matplotlib** – visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive experimentation

## Possible Extensions

* Applying more advanced optimization or learning methods
* Extending experiments to other extremal graph theory problems
* Comparing heuristic results with theoretical bounds
* Using the generated data as input for machine learning models

## Notes

This repository is intended as an **educational and exploratory GitHub project**. The focus lies on clarity, intuition, and experimentation rather than performance or completeness. It can serve as a learning resource, a course project, or a starting point for further research-oriented work.
